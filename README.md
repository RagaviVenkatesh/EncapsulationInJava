# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Encapsulation Demo â€“ Java OOP

This repo contains a simple Java project that demonstrates **Encapsulation**, one of the four core pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), using a fun and relatable **Netflix-style analogy**.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?

- `NetflixAccount.java` â€“ A class that encapsulates user data like username, premium status, and watch history.
- `Main.java` â€“ A test class to interact with the `NetflixAccount` object.
- Real-world inspired validations (e.g., upgrade to premium, add to watch history)
